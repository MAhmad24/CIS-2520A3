## Assignment Overview
What is the assignment about?  

Explain the purpose of the program and what it accomplishes.

The first qeustion in the assignment involves writing a C program that takes input as a fully parentesized  arithmetic expression of binary operators and converts that expresiion into a binary expression tree. Additionally, the program providies other functions such as printing the tree in order and full parenthesized, in pre-order, or in post-order, as well as the ability to calculate the answer for the equation after giving the used the chance to assign values to the variables. The second question involves reading a file that has 200 2-digit integers and sorting them in a 20x10 array with each row of the array being treated as an object. The program takes the sum of the first three integers as the key and the other seven being the information content. Then the program created a MAX-HEAL using the downheap algrithm and displays the results in the same given form (20x10 array)
